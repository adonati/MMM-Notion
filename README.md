FORK: Added ability to edit lists in Notion: edit text of items, edit 'Quantity' (numeric, 1-10), add and delete items. 
This results in a MUCH DIMINISHED FLEXIBILITY with the lists: they must have an 'Item' (text) column as the title, and a 'Quantity' numeric column, which may or may not be displayed.
There could be other columns, but editing isn't set up for those, nor adding rows. Also the new code is pretty terrible in a couple places.


# MMM-Notion

This is a module for the [MagicMirror²](https://github.com/MichMich/MagicMirror/).
This module shows you your favorite Notion databases on MagicMirror. All you need is to create a [Notion integration](https://www.notion.com/my-integrations), download this module and connect your Notion database. :raised_hands:

![](img/mmm-notion-showcase.png)

**NOTE:** This module is currently in development status. You can already use it, but there may be some bugs or changes in the configuration

## How to use

To show your Notion Database, you need to create a [Notion integration](https://www.notion.com/my-integrations). To do that, you need Admin level access on your Workspace. Notion has a very
good [documentation](https://developers.notion.com/docs/create-a-notion-integration) on how to create your integration and obtain the database id, but here is a summarized version of how to setup.

### Create an integration

To create a Notion integration, proceed as follows:

1. Visit https://www.notion.com/my-integrations in your browser.
2. Click the `+ New integration` button.
3. Name the integration.
4. Select the [capabilities](https://developers.notion.com/docs/authorization#integration-capabilities) that your integration will have (Read permission should be enough).
5. Click `Submit` to create the integration.

Paste the secret key in you MagicMirror config file (`config.secret`).


### Add integration to database

Now that you’ve created an integration, you need to grant it access to a database. For each database you want to display, you need to add the integration to the database

1. Go to the database page in your workspace.
2. Click the `•••` on the top right corner of the page.
3. At the bottom of the pop-up, click `Add connections`.
4. Search for and select your integration in the `Search for connections...` menu.

Your integration now has permission to edit the database.

### Obtain the database id

To get the database ID, copy the URL of your Notion database. If you're using an inline database, then make sure you're viewing the database as a full page. If you're using the Notion desktop app, then click `Share` and select `Copy link` to find the database URL.

The database ID is the string of characters in the database URL that is between the slash following your workspace name (if you named it) and the question mark. The ID is 32 characters long, containing numbers and letters.

Paste your Notion database id in you MagicMirror config file (`config.database.id`).

## Using the module

To use this module, add the following configuration block to the modules array in the `config/config.js` file:

```js
var config = {
  modules: [
    {
      module: 'MMM-Notion',
      config: {
        updateInterval: 60000,
        secret: "YOUR_NOTION_SECRET",
        databases: [
          {
            title: "My Notion Database",
            id: "NOTION_DATABASE_ID",
            layout: {
              type: "listview",
              showPersonWithNames: true,
              dateFormat: "full_date", // full_date, month_day_year, day_month_year, year_month_day, relative
              properties: ["Checkbox", "Name"]
            },
            filter: {
              "property": "Task completed",
              "checkbox": {
                "equals": true
              }
            },
            sorts: []
          },
          {
            title: "My other Notion Database",
            id: "NOTION_DATABASE_ID",
            layout: {
              type: "listview",
              properties: ["Date", "Status"]
            }
          }
        ]
      }
